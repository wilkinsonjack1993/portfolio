Do you or your team want to improve you skills in frontend and web development technologies? Then please reach out!

Having run a number of training sessions on a number topics spanning across the web development industry, I really enjoy sharing knowledge and seeing people grow as software engineers. Training sessions can be done online or in person and in a number of formats from pair programming sessions to a more traditional classroom approach.

I have also given a number of talks at meetups and conferences as a way of sharing knowledge so would be happy to do this also.

Topics that I have given talks or training sessions on before (but others are available):

- React for beginners
- Advanced React patterns
- Performance improvements for web applications
- Scalable Frontend Architecture
- Javascript, HTML and CSS (for a variety of experiences)
- Bundling and build systems
