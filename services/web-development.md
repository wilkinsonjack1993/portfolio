With over 5 years of development experience in web developent and software engineering, I have experience in a wide range of technologies and infrastructure.

I have worked across a wide range of industries from Fintech to Education, building everything from small project to complex web applications with analytics and integrations with payment systems such as stripe.

I also have a range of experience in
server side rendering, SEO and performance optimisations to maximise the user experience and increase traffic to website or platform.

I love working with clients to understand, build and improve their product or buisness in order for it to thrive in a performant manner. I am happy to give time estimates with a detailed breakdown of the work to be done and to give regular updates and feedback sessions as the project progresses.

If you are interested in working with me then please feel free to reach out for a no strings attached consultation.
