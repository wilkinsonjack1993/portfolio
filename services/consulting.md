Do you have an idea for an amazing product but are unsure where to start with it? Have you got a codebase which has grown so rapidly that it is starting to cause pain points and you are not sure how to fix it? Are you unsure how to ship your product to market? Or do you just need someone to bounce ideas off?

Then we can help! Having experience across a wide range of technologies and delivered many projects from conception to deployment, we have previously made the mistakes and found the solutions so you don't have to!

Planning is incredibly important and can have a massive effect on both the quality and speed of implementation of your project, so talking it through and finding out all the options can make a huge difference.

Topics that we have previously helped clients with:

- What technologies to use on a project
- How to optimise for performance
- How to convert a legacy code base to newer technologies
- How to scale a web application
- Application architecture
- Application deployment and monitoring
